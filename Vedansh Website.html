    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Avid golfer and tech enthusiast. Experience in basic level programming courses and projects. Also I have passion for finance, started with a personal investment account via TD Ameritrade and have learned how to invest and how stocks work. I am curious to learn more about finance and more about the world of investing, such as how hedge funds and investment banking work. Also curious to get knowledge of what jobs and careers exist in the realm of finance as well as ways one can diversify and grow in the finance world.
